## Background
In the world of DevOps, managing multiple tools on your computer can be quite a challenge. I know this struggle firsthand. Setting up each tool, ensuring they work together, and keeping them updated is a time-consuming and often frustrating process.

That's why I created the [DevOps Toolkit](https://github.com/tungbq/devops-toolkit) to solve these problems.
It's built on top of the [docker](https://www.docker.com/) platform. I wanted to make it easier for developers and operations teams to get started with DevOps without the headaches of tool compatibility, setup, maintenance, and keeping everything up to date.

## The DevOps Toolkit
- **GitHub repository:** [tungbq/devops-toolkit](https://github.com/tungbq/devops-toolkit)
- **Description:** DevOps toolkit is a container image for an all-in-one DevOps environment with popular tools like Ansible, Terraform, kubectl, helm, AWS CLI, Azure CLI, Git, Python and more...

## Key features

- **Pre-installed Tools**: Includes a variety of essential tools such as git, python, ansible, terraform, kubectl, helm, awscli, azurecli, etc.
- **Continuous Integration**: Utilizes full CI/CD for deployment to Docker Hub using GitHub Actions.
- **Documentation**: Provides detailed documentation for each tool included.
- **Regular Updates**: Weekly checks and updates for core tools ensure the toolkit's reliability and security.
- **Sample code**: Includes sample code demonstrating the usage of various tools available in the toolkit.
- **Support for Build Variants**: Enables users to customize the toolkit by building it with their preferred versions of each tool.

## Prerequisites üîì

Before you begin, ensure that you have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) installed. It's also helpful to have a basic understanding of Docker concepts.
If you are new to docker, don't worry, you can refer to this [document](https://github.com/tungbq/devops-basic/tree/main/topics/docker) to get started.

## Quick start üî•

```bash
docker run --network host -it --rm tungbq/devops-toolkit:latest
```

## Demo üì∫

Check out the full sample and instruction at [samples](https://github.com/tungbq/devops-toolkit/tree/main/samples/)

```bash
docker run --network host --rm tungbq/devops-toolkit:latest samples/run_sample.sh
```

## Getting started üìñ

### 1-Pull the official image from Docker Hub

DockerHub image: [tungbq/devops-toolkit](https://hub.docker.com/r/tungbq/devops-toolkit)

```bash
docker pull tungbq/devops-toolkit:latest
```

### 2-Build your own image (Optional)
Skip this step if you use the image from Dockerhub
- If you prefer to build your own image from the source code, refer to the [**build_toolkit_image**](https://github.com/tungbq/devops-toolkit/tree/main/docs/build/build_toolkit_image.md) instructions.
- We can customize the toolkit by building it with our preferred versions of each tool.

### 3-Start and explore the toolkit container

Once you have the image ready, you can start using the toolkit with the following commands

- Start devops-toolkit container

```bash
docker run --network host -it --rm tungbq/devops-toolkit:latest
```

- Now we are in the docker container terminal, let's explore it

```bash
root@docker-desktop:~# python3 --version
Python 3.12.2

root@docker-desktop:~# terraform --version
Terraform v1.7.5
on linux_amd64

root@docker-desktop:~# kubectl version
Client Version: v1.29.3
Kustomize Version: v5.0.4-0.20230601165947-6ce0bf390ce3

# ... more commands as your needed
```
